Fake news detection 
======

## Abstract
The proliferation of fake and manipulated news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information dissemination, particularly within the context of Russian media. This paper underscores the critical need for robust assessment frameworks to identify and mitigate the impact of such misinformation. By utilizing a comprehensive dataset, we aim to explore patterns and similarities in fake news narratives propagated by Russian sources. Through clustering techniques, we will analyze the dissemination strategies and thematic consistencies of these false narratives, and compare these clusters with geopolitical regions affected by Russian influence. Such analysis is vital for developing countermeasures and informing policy-making to combat misinformation. Additionally, we will create an interactive visualization tool to map the spread of fake news, providing a dynamic representation of data over various time periods and thematic attributes. This visualization will enhance our understanding of the data and validate our findings. Furthermore, we will evaluate the clusters' relevance by examining their correlation with real-world events and their potential utility in predictive modeling. This study not only highlights the pervasive nature of Russian fake news but also contributes to the development of effective strategies to counteract the dissemination of manipulated information.


## Goal
Inspired by famous [TEDx talk of Simon Sinek about How great leaders inspire action](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) we were wondering to answer three question: 

**1. WHY?** 
To master our skills and contribute to developments that strengthen Ukraineâ€™s position in the information war

**2. WHAT?** 
Develop a model capable of identifying fakes in news and social media


**3. HOW?**
Applying modern ML algorithmes to fake and propaganda texts
